# Data_Salary_Dashboard

The Power-BI-Dashboard project aims to analyze factors affecting the salary of data specialists, leveraging a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The project includes various files such as a project preview video, the Power BI dashboard file (Dashboard.pbix), project documentation (Project Docs.pdf), and datasets (eda_data.csv, glassdoor_jobs.csv, and Cleaned Jobs.csv). The dashboard features five report pages: Explore (for exploratory data analysis), Basic Analysis (focusing on basic salary factors), Drill (detailing skill ratios like Python and Excel), More Analysis (deep analysis of salary factors), and Complex Analysis (evaluating the impact of different skills on expected salaries). The project documentation details each step of the process, data definitions, cleaning steps, exploratory visuals, key questions, insights extracted from the analysis, and the visuals used to communicate these insights.
